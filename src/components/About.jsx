            Currently, I’m working as a Junior Frontend Developer at Digiweb Solutions (Australia), 
            where I design and maintain responsive, AI-powered websites, manage Google Ads campaigns, 
            and integrate third-party tools like Stripe, PayPal, CRM systems, and marketing automation 
            platforms. I love writing clean, scalable code and making sure the products I build are secure, 
            user-friendly, and accessible across devices.
